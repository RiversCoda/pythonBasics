: Building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images is of great significance in
urban planning, population statistics, and economic forecast. However, automatic building extraction
from high-resolution remote sensing images remains challenging. On the one hand, the extraction
results of buildings are partially missing and incomplete due to the variation of hue and texture
within a building, especially when the building size is large. On the other hand, the building
footprint extraction of buildings with complex shapes is often inaccurate. To this end, we propose
a new deep learning network, termed Building Residual Refine Network (BRRNet), for accurate
and complete building extraction. BRRNet consists of such two parts as the prediction module and
the residual refinement module. The prediction module based on an encoderâ€“decoder structure
